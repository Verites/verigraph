-- * Contexts and graph traversal
{- $contexts
In order to traverse or navigate through the graph, 'NodeContext's are provided. The context of a
node provides access to its incident edges and neighbour nodes without explicitly looking them up
in the graph. Internally, nodes and edges are still being looked up, so keep in mind there's no
performance benefit. This module, however, can guarantee that this implicit lookup will work, so
there's no need to deal with `Maybe` values.

An example is presented in the documentation for 'Data.Graphs'.

{- $neighbours

In order to access the neighbour nodes of the edges, one may simply go through the edges, e.g.

>   map (\(_, _, target) -> target) . outgoingEdges
>   map (\(source, _, _) -> source) . incomingEdges

These operations were not added to the graph API because it is not yet clear which of them are commonly used, and which names would be appropriate. If you identify the need for such an operation, submit an issue on github.
