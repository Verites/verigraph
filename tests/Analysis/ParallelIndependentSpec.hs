-- This test is based on that the pullback scheme for detecting parallel
-- or sequentially independece is identical to find for delete-use.
-- Considering the simplicity of the delete-use and assuming it is correct,
-- we compare it with pullback scheme that runs two calculatePullback calls for instance.
